An ATmega8 based Sous-Vide Temperature Controller

Sous-Vide is a cooking method for a very gentle preparation of meat and vegetables. The general idea is sealing the
food in a vacuum bed and then cooking it in a water bath with a maximum temperature of about 60째C to 70째C for an extended time.
Important cooking reactions (including sterilization) start at around 50째C, but unwanted processes (e.g. meat getting stringy)
increase above 70째C. Because of the lower temperatures the cooking time is elonged, but you get a very even and reproducible
result from the process.

## Overview
### Hardware
On the hardware side (schematics and layout KiCAD format) an ATmega8 regulates the temperature of the water bath with a TRIAC
controlled immersion heater. It is advised to use an acquarium water pump to better spread the heat in the bath. A DS18x2x type
Dallas 1Wire sensor is used for temperature monitoring. The UART can be used to communicate with a ESP8266 type WiFi module, but
is used in the prototype for serial communication and control.

### Firmware
A straight-forward, modularized fixed-point PID controller.

Uses the UART library from Peter Fleury, the 1wire library by Peter Dannegger and the libfixmath by Ben Brewer.

### PC Control Software
Qt5, QCustomPlot, nice.
